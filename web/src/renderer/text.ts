 * The rectangle that a text node ACTUALLY PAINTS, which is not its box.

 * The model's box is not a limit for drawing and never has been:
 * `drawText` places line `i` at `y = n.y + ascent + i * lineHeight` without
 * looking at `n.height`, `drawScene` clips nothing, and nobody rewrites
 * the measured height into the node (the editing textarea grows, the node
 * does not). A node created with a click is ONE line tall: it is enough to go to a new line
 * once for the text to leave the box and keep showing on screen.
 *
 * Whoever draws can afford to ignore it -- the screen canvas is as large
 * as the window. Whoever CROPS cannot: the export sizes the file on the bounds,
 * so with the model's box it would throw away everything below the
 * first line, silently and with a file that looks successful. That is why the
 * text measure enters even into the computation of the region to export.
 *
 * It is the UNION of the box and the lines, never a replacement: a box taller than
 * the text (dragged by the user, or left so after deleting
 * lines) remains part of what is exported, exactly as it is on screen.
 * Horizontal overflow counts like vertical, and exists in
 * both directions: a word wider than the box is broken but a
 * single glyph is not (breakWord never rejects a single character), and with
 * right alignment that remainder sticks out to the LEFT of the box.
